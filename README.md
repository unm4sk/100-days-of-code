## Who am I?
Hi there! My name is Daniil and I am *very passionate* about coding. I like its concepts and, more significantly, ways programming can be implemented to make real-world changes. Because this repo is not only about me & stuff that I like/dislike, etc., I will link a [README file](https://github.com/unm4sk/unm4sk/blob/main/README.md "My README file") <- (*click here* if you wanna learn about me a little!)

My twitter: [click here!](https://twitter.com/real_unm4sk) You can also track my progress there!

## Why I decided to join this challenge?
Being a student is *not the easiest thing* (at least for me), and it is hard to concentrate on something with bunch of h/w, social activities, hobbies, social media, etc that keep falling on a student's head. To overcome my procrastination and make significant improvements in my programming journey, I decided to join this challenge!

## My directions
1. Firstly, complete a Python course.
2. Create my own site â€” a portfolio one.
3. Decide where I want to go with Python (try different projects and directions). 
4. Complete a Flutter course.
5. Create my biggest project which I had in my mind for tooooo long! (it's a bit of a secret now, but when I publish my first beta on GitHub, it won't be anymore!)

## If you've decided to join:
#### Offical Instructions
0.  Check out [the Official Site](http://100daysofcode.com/) for the #100DaysOfCode movement. Connect with others on the platform of your choice from this list: www.100DaysOfCode.com/connect
    Also, [here](https://www.100daysofcode.com/slack) is a invite link to the 100DaysOfCode Slack channel
1.  Read [Join the #100DaysOfCode](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4)
2.  Fork this repo and commit to the [Log](log.md) or to the Alternative, rapid [R1 Log](r1-log.md) (R1 stands for Round 1) daily. [Example](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-kallaway-log).
3.  **Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.**
4.  **Encourage at least two other people in the challenge on Twitter every day! Pay it forward!**
5.  Change the date in [Rules](rules.md) to the day you've started the challenge.
6.  Delete the examples in the log, or comment them out, and start filling it with your own content.
7.  **Tweet your progress every day using the #100DaysOfCode hashtag.**
8.  Follow [Alex, creator of #100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/ka11away) & [100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/_100DaysOfCode) Twitter Bot that retweets the tweets that contain the #100DaysOfCode hashtag. It's a great way to keep yourself motivated and to participate in the community. Thanks [@amanhimself](https://twitter.com/amanhimself) for creating it!
9.  Important: (see No.4 above for a specific rule on this) Encourage others who are doing the same challenge on Twitter or elsewhere - by giving them props when they are posting updates on their progress, supporting them when things get difficult. Thus we will grow a community that is helpful and effective, which will lead to a higher success rate for each person involved. It's also more likely that you will stick to your own commitment, given that you will get acquainted with a couple people (or more) right away.
10.  If you find a great, helpful resource that others would benefit from, either submit a Pull Request to add it to the repo, or just tweet at me (see info below)
