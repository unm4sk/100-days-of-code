### R1D1 
Learned a lot new about decorators. Still pretty confusing, but I am getting better at understanding how this concept works.

### R1D2
Finished learning decorators. Got a bit closer to fully understanding a concept!ðŸ˜Ž The power of this function is incredible! Did an excercise to implement what I've learned so far about decorators.
Finished Error Handling part of a course. Was pretty easy because I had implemented it before. However, some things I did *not* know, so it was pretty useful overall. [files to be uploaded]
