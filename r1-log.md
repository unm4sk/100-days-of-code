# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [unm4sk]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [January 25, Tuesday, 2022].

## Log

### R1D1 
Learned a lot new about decorators. Still pretty confusing, but I am getting better at understanding how this concept works. 

Time track: ![error](./time-track/1.jpg "1st")

### R1D2
Finished learning decorators. Got a bit closer to fully understanding a concept!ðŸ˜Ž The power of this function is incredible! Did an excercise to implement what I've learned so far about decorators.
Finished Error Handling part of a course. Was pretty easy because I had implemented it before. However, some things I did *not* know, so it was pretty useful overall. [files to be uploaded]

Time track: ![error](./time-track/2.png "2nd")

### R1D3
Didn't pay too much attention for course and decided to spend it implementing gained knowledge about pure functions. I bumped into some problems, esp. with dictionaries and getting values (was using API).
Nevertheless, built a working but not beauty and fully-fledged script. Planning to make it look beautiful and informative!
It is in early development, so I am not sharring a link to my project. If tomorrow won't be so hard day I will upload it on GitHub.
Overall, I am *more* than just satisfied!

### R1D4
Oooh. With no doubt it was the most time I have coded in a day. My thoughts? Don't feel exhausted, not at all! Finished my [defme](https://github.com/unm4sk/defme) project. I have not only implemented libraries I wanted to, but also made my code more logical & clear. Also, I did an *Excel* version of my script. It is way better in terms of perfomance. 
I am very proud of myself, to be honest :) 
I think tomorrow I will focus on a course becaue of opportunities it can provide to me.

### R1D5
Getting used to coding this many hours, haha. No, seriously, feel like it's really possible.
Of course, there were moments today when I felt little unconcentrated and sleepy. So far, I finished the generators section and in the middle of *Modules in Python* section. 
Completed a cool game excercise using built-in sys module. Now it's very cool to execute a game in a *USER mode*, adding attributes when running a program!
Looking for tomorrow's journey! (Probably will code less time cuz of school h/w)

Also, completed 2 Python Exams. Got good scores, remembered some stuff. Feel very good about that!

### R1D6
Even though the beggining of today wasn't that great (a great bunch of school assignments, got very exhaused), I spent some great time creating & refreshing my knowledge about OOP. It was hard for me to understand *why* I may want to use it in my projects, but I think I am getting the idea behind this concept.

I finished the Python modules and debugging section. I actually never really used debugging. Now I see its power.

Apart from learning the course, I built 2 projects, implementing OOP (one from youtube, the second one I did all by myself).
I'll try my best to implement a *database* to my project and will use *Rich* again to create beautiful desing for it.

### R1D7
What day it was... I coded for **8 hours**! But even though time I spent coding was enormous (still attended school), I didn't feel exhausted, tired or unmotivated. In fact, I felt exactly opposite!

All my time I spent coding a project using OOP. I think I'll upload it on GitHub soon. 

Shortly, today I:
* almost finished my project
* learned how to use tinydb and rich for creating tables
* fixed lots and lots of bugs
* implemented new features (some of them I'll try to implement tomorrow)

Talking about tomorrow... 
TODO:
1. Finish My Project
2. Watch File IO
Although programming is really driving me crazy (in a good way -- I am super motivated rn and don't fear dificculties), I think I should start do my h/ws better and *start finally preparing for SAT!*
