## Log

### R1D1 
Learned a lot new about decorators. Still pretty confusing, but I am getting better at understanding how this concept works. 

Time track: ![error](./time-track/1.jpg "1st")

### R1D2
Finished learning decorators. Got a bit closer to fully understanding a concept!😎 The power of this function is incredible! Did an excercise to implement what I've learned so far about decorators.
Finished Error Handling part of a course. Was pretty easy because I had implemented it before. However, some things I did *not* know, so it was pretty useful overall. [files to be uploaded]

### R1D3
Didn't pay too much attention for course and decided to spend it implementing gained knowledge about pure functions. I bumped into some problems, esp. with dictionaries and getting values (was using API).
Nevertheless, built a working but not beauty and fully-fledged script. Planning to make it look beautiful and informative!
It is in early development, so I am not sharring a link to my project. If tomorrow won't be so hard day I will upload it on GitHub.
Overall, I am *more* than just satisfied!
